he circus plots are very compact and can be highly informative. However, they can also be quite tricky to create.
Here, I have set up a circus plot to compare bar charts between two (or more) groups.

Note: Randomly generated data has been used here.
Note: Make sure to update the x and y values accordingly.

Enjoy it!
